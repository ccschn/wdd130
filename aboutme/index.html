    <h2>Clarrissa Schneider</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Clarrissa Schneider, BYU-I still has my maiden name, Boggs, listed. I am majoring in Applied Technology, currently working on the Web and Computer Programming certificate. I am interested in working with companies to make their websites more user friendly, which is why I am taking this class and working towards this certificate.</p>
    <p>I love to read books and am learning to garden. I also enjoy playing games including card games, board games, and console games.</p>
    <p>I have been married for 7 years. We have two young children, a girl and then a boy. I got a bachelorâ€™s degree before having children and am now going back to school in a very different area.</p>
