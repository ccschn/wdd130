      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a seamstress. I work mainly with Christmas stockings. My company makes individualized stockings for everyone. You can choose your own stocking colors (doesn’t have to just be red) and pick from all sorts of different designs to be embroidered onto the stocking to make them last and be unique. Have you ever pulled out your Christmas stockings and wished they were more personalized and special, not quite so generic, and tacky? I do that for families. I keep the magic of Christmas alive year after year, with completely customizable elegant stockings. Stockings for every style of the season. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The website is targeted to adults, mainly those in their 20s to late 50s who have families or a love of Christmas decorating. By offering a wide range of fabric colors and embroidery patterns, people can design their perfect Christmas stocking. We are targeting people who are middle class and higher who want Christmas decorations that have meaning and purpose behind them, not just a generic stocking bought at a grocery store. Our website will mainly be accessed from a laptop or desktop computer.</p>  <!-- change this -->
